#Boxmark it!#

A cloud based bookmarking tool.

Boxmark it! saves all your bookmarks (**boxmarks**) on your Dropbox account by utilizing the (now deprecated) Datastores API and JavaScript SDK.

Boxmark it! is a personal project I started as a way to familiarize myself with the Dropbox Datastores API and since it's deprecated now, Boxmark it! will never be anything more than just a concept.

**Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery UI, AJAX, PHP, PhantomJS, Datastores API**
